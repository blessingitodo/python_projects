## **Thread Shed**
Thread Sed is a local sewing hobby shop. This project uses string methods, loops, conditional statements and  user-defined functions to clean the data for Thread Shed's outdated register. The transaction information is stored in one huge string called daily_sales. All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. The goal is to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.
